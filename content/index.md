Welcome! This is a project by [Aria](https://aria.coffee) to get as much information about transitioning as she can into one place!

This page will link to different broad topics and those will link to individual bits of info, don't feel the need to take all of this in, just look for what applies to you or what you want to learn more about.

There will be LOTS of linking to other websites, I feel these websites already have great descriptions and info on the topic, no need to rewrite words someone has done beautifully already.
