Welcome! This is a project by [Aria](https://aria.coffee) to get as much information about transitioning as she can into one place!

This page will link to different broad topics and those will link to individual bits of info, don't feel the need to take all of this in, just look for what applies to you or what you want to learn more about.

There will be LOTS of linking to other websites, I feel these websites already have great descriptions and info on the topic, no need to rewrite words someone has done beautifully already.

## Why?

I am from a small rural town in Australia and found myself needing to learn a TON of info about transitioning on my own with heavy research so I could safely begin my transition on my own.

After learning about and  talking to a few other trans individuals I learnt many of them don't have enough information on their own medication or where to actually begin, I am *f\*\*\*ing* sick of people not having that info.

I want to get this out to as many individuals that need it as possible and make all this info accessible easily.
